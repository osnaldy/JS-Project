    <h5 class="fontStyle"><b>In this project we will learn about the crime rate between Chicago and Louisiana for the years of 2012 to 2015.</b></h5>

    <p class="p1">
        When I was thinking about ideas to come up with my project,
        I figured that it would be interesting for people to know if one place is safer than the other.
        Sometimes one may ask, if it is safe to take their family on vacation, or move to one of these places.
        The only way to find out is by doing the data crime analysis of these two places.
        Therefore, I decided to work on Louisiana and Chicago to show people where, in these two places,
        the crime is higher. I also intend to show the correlation between both places for people to see whether
        crime changes together in both places. In order to make things more interesting,
        I decided to include the weather of Louisiana and Chicago for the same period of time to understand if
        the weather affects the crime rate in these two places.
        The code to this project can be found in my <u><a href="https://github.com/osnaldy/CMP-464">Github account</a></u>
    </p>

    <h4 class="fontStyle"><b>Datasets for this project.</b></h4>

    <p class="p1">
        As stated before, in this project I downloaded the Robbery crime for Chicago and Louisiana to proceed
        with my analysis. The dates chosen were from the year of 2012 to 2015 for both places.
        Both data were extracted from the corresponding open data website for each place. Furthermore,
        the weather was extracted from the Weather Wunderground for the same period of time.

    </p>

    <h4 class="fontStyle"><b>Techniques.</b></h4>

    <p class="p1">
        In this graph I intend to show the viewer crime between 2012 to 2015 for Chicago.
        In this graph, I plotted the crime by month for Chicago.
        Each line in the graph represents a full year and how the crime changes per month.
    </p>

    <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/Chicago_2012-2015.png">

    <p class="p1">
        Then, I proceeded to plot the graph for Louisiana. Similar to the one above,
        the viewer sees how the crime changes from 2012 to 2015. In this graph,
        the crime is plotted by month as well for Louisiana.
        Each line in the graph represents a full year and how the crime changes per month.
    </p>

    <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="images/Louisiana_2012-2015.png">

    <p class="p1">
        In the following graph, I will show the analysis of project of whether the crime of both places
        correlate together as the time goes by. To obtain this graph, I calculated the average per month
        for Louisiana for the years chosen, 2012 to 2015, and added them together to create one single line.
        I also did the same steps for Chicago to have single line. With the array retrieved from this calculation,
        I used it to calculate the correlation between both place to see if the crime changes together.
        As a result, I obtained the correlation to be 70.6%.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">
        As I keep making analysis, in this next graph I will show if the weather has any effect on the
        crime rate for the Chicago. To complete this analysis, I extracted the weather by day,
        and then found the average per month for each year. After I found the average per month
        for each year, I proceeded to average each but for the whole four years to obtain a single array.
        Once I found those values, I calculated the correlation between the weather, for 2012 to 2015,
        and the total value crime for Chicago. As conclusion, I discovered it only correlates at 64.7%.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">
        Furthermore, I took the same steps as before to conclude with my analysis and show
        if the weather has any effect on the crime rate, but now it was done for Louisiana.
        The graph below shows that the between the total weather average and the total crime average,
        only exits 69.7% of correlation.
